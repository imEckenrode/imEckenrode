## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I am Ian Eckenrode, a software developer with too many personal projects. Formally, I have degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I love learning, solving problems, and creating. An internet search of my name finds my high school sports, but will not find the music and games I make with my siblings, nor will it find my volleyball team, workout plans, or home movies. Of all my skillsets, I most enjoy the struggles and successes throughout the software development process; planning, programming, testing, and presenting.

I use this profile to manage my newer personal projects (unfortunately I did not learn Git at age 12), so if you're reading this, welcome to my personal Readme! Not much to see here.
